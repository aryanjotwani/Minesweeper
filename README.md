This project is an implementation of the classic Minesweeper game along with an AI solver. The game provides a graphical interface for the user to interact with the grid, revealing cells and flagging potential mines. The AI solver uses logical inference to make moves and strategize in order to solve the game automatically.

How the AI Works:

The AI employs logical reasoning and knowledge representation to deduce safe moves.
It maintains a set of sentences, each representing a group of cells and the count of neighboring mines.
The AI iterates over these sentences, marking mines or safe cells based on the known information.
